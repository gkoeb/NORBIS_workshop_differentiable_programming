Small data and differentiable programming: Questions for discussion
===================================================================

**1.** **(everyone)** Place a dot on the "coordinate system" on the flipchart, indicating where you would mostly locate your current work: ![](pictures/coordinatesystem.png)

Small data 
---

**2.** **(Groups 1,2,3)** Can you think of examples for “big” and “small” datasets in your discipline or research sub-field? 

**2.** **(Groups 4,5,6)** How would you define “small data” as opposed to big data, what characteristics would you take into account? 

Differentiable programming 
--- 
**3.** **(Groups 1,2)** What is the core idea of differentiable programming that you got from the blogpost? 

**4.** **(Groups 3,4)** How does differentiable programming work in practice / what are the necessary core technologies? 

**4.** **(Groups 5,6)** Can you think of an example for a task or an application where you would use something like deep learning, and of a task where you prefer explicit modeling? Why? 

**5.** **(everyone)** Please identify a statement you didn’t fully understand, and discuss those in your group. Choose one and write it on a flash card.
